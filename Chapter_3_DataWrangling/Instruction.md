# Instruction for Chapter 3

1. Download "data_wrangling_x.html" and "xaringan-themer.css" from the "Chapter_3_DataWrangling" folder from the following dropbox folder 
 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hd5axyagsg91nu2/AADo4yP3YXGwLDz3MUnn4a4ca?dl=0

2. Make sure that the downloaded files do not have numbers like this at the end: "xaringan-themer(1).css". This happens when there already was a file that has the same name in the same folder (e.g., "downloads" folder). The html files look for "xaringan-themer.css" for slide formatting. So, if the css file you just downloaded is named like "xaringan-themer(1).css", then the html file would be using the old css file for formatting. Please let me know if you still have trouble getting the slides correctly formatted.

3. Download the following files from the "Chapter_3_data_wrangling" folder after clicking here (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pyvwos3z7djkpbz/AADZzFgyxtNH2sTyJ3G9DYxua?dl=0)

+ corn_yields.csv
+ corn_yields.dta
+ corn_yields.rds
+ corn_yields.xls

Place them in the same folder. Make sure that the file names are exactly the same as the original file names. 

4. Install the "tidyverse", "AER", and "nycflights13" packages and library them on RStudio

<!-- 4. Get the path to the folder where you placed the four datasets above  
5. Open RStudio and run setwd("the path to the folder") so that your working directory is the dataset folder -->




Notes to me: 4 and 5 should be done in the class the first time.
